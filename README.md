# About ‚úç
The Minishell project is essentially about creating a simple shell‚Äîyes, our own little bash‚Äîwhich my peer [Vin√≠cius Vaccari](https://github.com/vivaccar) and I affectionately nicknamed GAUSHELL. Our program replicates the shell environment, prompting a command-line, executing commands with pipes and redirects, manipulating environment variables, handling signals, and supporting various other shell features.

#  Walkthrough üß©
The project was divided in three big parts: Tokenizer, Parser and Execution.

### Tokenizer
The first thing a shell does when receive a command-line is to divide the string in ``tokens``, that, as we decided, will be separated in twelve different types: ``WHITE SPACE``, ``WORD`` (that later is considered as a command), ``PIPE``, ``ENV`` (dollar sign), ``REDIRECT_IN``, ``REDIRECT_OUT``, ``DOUBLE REDIRECT_OUT``, ``HEREDOC``, ``SINGLE QUOTE``, ``DOUBLE QUOTE``, ``FILE`` and ``NULL``.

We also check the status of each token, defined by three types: ``GENERAL`` (no quotes), `√åN_SINGLE_QUOTE` or `IN_DOUBLE_QUOTE`.

To understand better, let's demonstrate what tokenizer does with the following command-line example:
